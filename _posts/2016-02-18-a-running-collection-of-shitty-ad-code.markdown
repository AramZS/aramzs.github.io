I'm now keeping a collection of terrible awful no-good ad-tech code. This isn't just code that tracks you, I mean code that is actually written terribly and breaks sites all around the web.

All of this is simply obtained by clicking on the link in the console to the file that contains the terrible ad code when it is executed on the site. Occasionally I run it through [jsbeautifier][js-beautifier] for your pleasure.

Many of these scripts are run (usually breaking themselves, if not the sites they are on) daily across the web.

So here we go:

 - [AdapTV](#adaptv)
 - [TruEffect](#trueffect)
 - [Moat Video](#moatvideo)
