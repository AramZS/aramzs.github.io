A great interview in VICE today with an engineer who quit GitHub over their ICE contract.

Sophie Haskins:

> It certainly frustrates me how apolitical tech is. It’s so individualistic and siloed. It’s unacceptable. The idea of tech for its own sake, and tech on its own terms makes me angry to no end.
>
> Technology should be tools to help people, to enable humans. Even beyond moral questions, many engineers just make bad technology because they don’t think about humans when they’re making it. They’re obsessed with the technical details— but you have to start to realize your actions have consequences. It is indefensible to lack morals in software when we have such a huge impact.
