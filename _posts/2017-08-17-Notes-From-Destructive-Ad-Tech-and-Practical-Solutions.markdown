 - What is Audience and Revenue Strategy?
  - Consults with content creators to drive core business objectives with a focus on revenue optimization
  - collaborates with multidisciplinary delivery teams to implement recommended strategies.
 - Ads are an experience problem
 - Ad tech erodes the experience of the open web
 - Mal-advertising has created fundamental security concerns
 - The publishing industry is much slower than the rest of the web
 - Greater than 3 secs to load = abandon for 40%
 - Chews through data plans
 - "We are shrinking ... our audience" by using bad ad tech.
 - The way we are treating our users is foundational.
 - If we're partially responsible, how do we fulfill that responsibility
 - Responsibly experiment
  - Improve user experience
  - add revenue opportunities
  - create real value for partner brands
  - leverage existing technology to control cost
 - Create opportunities for brands to become partners and sponsor content.
  - Not advatorials, but content sponsorship
  - Little logos we apply next to partner content.
  - Taxonomies allows for granular targeting
  ad management and reporting in your ad manager, like DFP
  - Little logo gets counted as an ad impression
  - Don't have Supported By and Advatorial stuff live on the same site; if you must be VERY clear about what is advatorial.
  - It's all about the context - using sponsorship has to fit.
  - Build a sponsorship taxonomy.
  - Can be further administrated with other taxonomies, like teams, tv shows, pre-game, in-game, post-game, etc...
  - Sell a game 3 times.
  - Doesn't require you to cookie the user.
  - My job is to 'set ad ops teams up for success'
  - Clickthrough CURL, logo, manage creative, all that done in DFP. You take the taxonomy and send it to DFP as a key value for the unit and get returned the correct logo, controlled by the ad ops team, complete with tracking pixels.
 - "Fluid" size in DFP = "native style"
  - Set up the ad once inside DFP w/engineers and then the ad ops people can populate the template
  - native style
  - truely responsive ads.
  - creative template to be set up with html and CSS inside doubleclick.
  - Uses professional tools
 - Affiliate links
  - Recognize that affiliate links are content
  - leverage custom post types
  - Collect links into a post.
  - Create templates that are clearer calls to action, picture, price, etc...
  - A very familiar interface - custom post type - for editors
  - Product categories for what it is, connections for what it connects to (posts the link is in.)
  - Use media screen shortcode ui (shortcake, I guess), put affiliate link in to there.
  - Script to migrate existing links into the system automatically
  - Connection with Amazon's API to bring in product meta and images.
  - ElasticPress for better automated curation
  - Replace aging or sold out Etsy links automatically.
  - "Publishers have agency here, they're part of the problem & they should be part of the solution"
  - It has to be more automated otherwise it doesn't get used.
 - Marketers - is any of this [targeting] working at all?
 - If you're working for brand awareness professors believe you shouldn't be so hyper focused.
 - Brands don't need to track you everywhere, they can figure you out with just a few data points.
 - Corporate partnerships are harder to sell and maintain.
 - If you want to do partnerships right IMO - you should not sell partnerships around total volume of ad impressions and clicks - you should know what the client needs (brand awareness) and how to measure it and deliver that.
