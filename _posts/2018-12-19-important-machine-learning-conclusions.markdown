I spotted this [on Twitter from user Zach Lieberman](https://twitter.com/zachlieberman/status/1074470650289491968) and thought it was well worth keeping a copy of here, as it speaks so well to the type of thinking I made this blog to explore. The slide is part of a presentation by privacy educator, technologist and writer [Janus Rose](https://twitter.com/zenalbatross).

The image of the slide reads: 
<blockquote>
Conclusions: 
- Human bodies & emotions are increasingly machine readable 
- Machine-readability allows emotional manipulation & automated enforcement of pre-existing oppressive structures 
- STOP asking "how can this be made ethically?" - start asking 'hy should this exist at all?" 
- The legacy code of all technology is the society that created it: white supremacist, imperialist, cis-hetero patriarchal societies will produce tech embedded with those values 
- Machine learning is intersectional or it's bullshit 
</blockquote>
