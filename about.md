This is the GitHub.io site for [Aram Zucker-Scharff][aram].

Aram has numerous blogs and websites, too many really, this particular one is focused on questions of technology, how it works, and how we can use it ethically and sustainably.

You can also find him on [LinkedIn][linkedin].

Everything he reads is at [Chronoto.pe][chronoto].

You can find an archive of everything he's written anywhere at his [Nodality][nodality].

I love talking about Ad Tech, but if you are a reporter looking for a comment for an article you might be better off [speaking to these people first](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jc0OMAI-fy9Ki2YpXv4yTE2gS7uXgI39ozBkBD0QSnI/edit?usp=sharing) who are way smarter about most of this than I.
