Recently there's been a lot of conversation about doxxing, if a particular action counts as doxxing, and if it is ok. I've found that arguments over the ethics of the situation often revolve on if the action was a doxx. That's part of it, but the other part is that there are indeed situations in which it would be ethical to doxx someone and we tend not to acknowledge that. 

The first question is: what counts as doxxing? There are a variaty of definitions out there and all of them tend to come under dispute. I'm going to be very strict in my interpretation here: doxxing is revealing personal identity information about a person without their consent. This is a more stringent definition than most, but I think it is accurate to how I think about doxxing. With this frame all of the following are doxxing:

 - Revealing the real life name of someone who was previously posting under an anonymous username. 
 - Revealing the real life location of someone who is posting under their real life name. 
 - Taking efforts to significantly publicize the employer and employer contact information of someone who might have been previously public with their name but didn't make that information widely available. 

Two major things to note here: First: I consider doxxing to be the revelation of anything that would make it significantly easier to push a person into real life consiquences for digital behavior. Second: I think that taking information that was public in a narrowly-available way and pushing it to be public in a broadly available way is indeed doxxing. 

The baseline standard for what I consider doxxing? Does it make harassing a person significantly easier? If the answer is yes, then it is likely doxxing. 


Ok, so now I have established what doxxing is. Is it ever ok? 

*Yes*

I think that doxxing, under ethical rules and considerations, is an important and relevent journalistic function. There are people who take advantage of operating in the dark and they use that anonymity in ways that responsible people should see as reason to withdraw that protection. That said, there are serious bars to doxxing someone I think are worth considering before making a decsison. I'll put all the rules at the top and go into detail below. 

1. Does the doxxing achieve a journalistic objective? 
2. Have you fully confirmed this information is true and accurate? 
3. If you have doxxed this person through your own research have you documented that research and made your methods transparent and honest?
4. Are you minimizing harm? 
5. Have you added context?
6. Is this person a public figure or do they deserve to be?
7. Are you of punching up? 
8. Is the only possible use of this information unethical?

#### (1) Does the doxxing achive a journalistic objective?

Does the revelation of personally identifying information about this person provide a larger context? If just the identity alone does not provide a larger context, is revealing in the service of a larger piece of reportage in which the identity of this person is a relevent fact to the larger story; or in which their attempt to seek annonymity is contextually relevent? Is this information the public needs to know?

If the answer to these questions is no, then perhaps it doesn't even make sense to persue the person's identity. 

#### (2) Have you fully confirmed this information is true and accurate? 

Before taking any further steps is this information verified? 'Someone tweeted it' and 'Reddit said it was true' are both not valid verification. A real human or a legitimate news organization both count as verification.

#### (3) If you have doxxed this person through your own research have you documented that research and made your methods transparent and honest?

If you are doxxing a person purely with your own information and have confirmed to your own satisfaction that your methods are accurate can you account for those methods? You should publicly document them.

#### (4) Are you minimizing harm? 

While many of these rules are built on top of [SPJ's code of ethics](https://www.spj.org/ethicscode.asp) this one is more directly applicable. Use compasion, avoid arrogance and avoid pandering to lurid curiousity. Particularly notable: 

> – Show compassion for those who may be affected by news coverage. Use heightened sensitivity when dealing with juveniles, victims of sex crimes, and sources or subjects who are inexperienced or unable to give consent. Consider cultural differences in approach and treatment. 

> – Recognize that legal access to information differs from an ethical justification to publish or broadcast. 

This is especially relevent in the modern age where identifying even a Twitter account can open someone up to significant online harassment. If doxxing a person would open them to harassment or significant offline consiquences then the question has to be asked: does the journalistic value of this reporting--in whole or in part--outweigh the potential harm? 

#### (5) Have you added context?

There are very few cases in which saying "Accout X is Person Y" or "Person Y is at Address Z" is in the public interest. There are exceptions, but if all you are doing is just revealing personal information about a person against their wishes you may just be an asshole, not fulfilling and ethical imperitive. Ask yourself: 'What's the story here?' and if the story is 'this Twitter account is this person' then you likely have failed to reach the bar for an ethical dox.

#### (6) Is this person a public figure or do they deserve to be?

Hopefully this has been addressed when considering the first and fourth rules, but it is especially important and so deserves special mention. Again from SPJ's code of ethics:

> – Realize that private people have a greater right to control information about themselves than public figures and others who seek power, influence or attention. Weigh the consequences of publishing or broadcasting personal information.  

This does not mean that only public figures are eligible for doxxing, but it does mean that people who are not already public and known figures deserve special consideration.

#### (7) Are you of punching up? 

This is particularly relative to the situation, in that it means that there are cases where it makes sense and is ethical for one person to doxx Person Y but not for another person. It is especially relevent where people share a peer association. It might be unethical for me to doxx someone who is another engineer or journalist if they are relatively minor in the field or if they work for me. 

On the other hand, revealing that an abusive Twitter account is actually a VP in your company is legitimate. When someone is of equal stature or when you have significant influence over their professional field you should consider strongly if you are the right person to be doing the doxx. Perhaps it would be more approrptie to pass that information to a professional journalist who could hopefully consider it with more abstract judgment. 

If you are going to doxx someone, don't punch down. Being in that situation compromises your judgement and it will likely make you look petty and unreliable anyway.

#### (8) Is the only possible use of this information unethical?

Perhaps this applies to your entire action, or perhaps only to a piece of it, but it is important to consider. If you reveal a piece of data that has no conceivable use except to help people harass the person, then don't. A good rule of thumb is: would this help a third-party sign up for a magazine subscription or a credit card on behalf of the subject of the doxx? Personal home addresses feature promenently among the datapoints that shouldn't be revealed with a doxx.

### In Practice

Let's consider some real and theoretical situations that can illustrate how to use these rules:

### You disagree?

At the height of some rather strident arguments on my Facebook page around (sigh) ethics in video game journalism I decided to enact some rules about how commenters are supposed to behave within comment threads with my face on the top post. Previously though these rules were written for me, a reminder for when I get angry and illogical, that there are ways I should act and standards that I want to hold myself to. 

That's the intent here too. I will apply these rules to places I control (these days the only place I could conceivably doxx someone is in the comments sections of my old WordPress blogs) but this is intended as a reminder and a standard of how I want to act ethically on the internet. I will use them to understand and react to other situations, but I don't intend to hold anyone to them. These are my rules for me, you can adopt them (or not) and they are what I consider to be the ethical standard in my eyes, but they are dependent on my judgement and so aren't intended as a gold standard.
