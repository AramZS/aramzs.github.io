 - Your short term business survival requires you to balance reader growth with revenue per reader / engagement.
 - Balance against shorter attention spans and fast use on mobile.
 - The concept of multi-channel distribution isn't new.
  - The Associated Press
  - MSN
  - CompuServe
  - LexisNexis
 - Early web was just another relatively basic secondary channel.
 - Browser 'channels' were an early failure.
 - RSS, XMLRPC, JSON
 - Two axis for thinking about content distribution
  - Axis 1: the open web has turned to crap and we can do the same thing but better channels - evolution
  - A responsive screen of text and pictures is so 2016 channels - revolution
  - Axis 2: This is a different way of doing things but have at it developers - open
  - It would be best if you let us control everything and we'll keep this pretty simple - constrained.
  - As you go from constrained evolution to open revolution opportunity and complexity increases.
 - Alexa is about changing the way content is consumed.
 - Apple News and Facebook Instant Articles are examples of 'We can do that better for you.'
 - Early content entry systems were just about typing into the platform
 - CMS as website design systems
 - The notion that your website is not part of your CMS, but just another channel - the CMS as the hub of a multi-channel strategy.
  - More important:
   - Editorial & writing experience
   - Ecosystem of 3rd party integrations
  - Moderate emphasis
   - APIs & data accessibility (may rise highly in importance soon)
  - Reduced emphasis
   - Website generation/presentation systems
   - Website layout & design tools.
 - IOT - an ecosystem of third party integrations
 - Creation experience may remove itself from the CMS.
 - What it means?
  - Content creation and curation experience is what it is all about.
  - Editorial UX is higher value than the website rendering system.
  - Extensibility, openness and APIs are vital.
  - Custom is crazy, economies of scale apply. Larger developer communities will adapt faster
  - WordPress to App
  - Platform and content control is even more important. An open platform that protects publishers from 3rd party business interests and choices.
