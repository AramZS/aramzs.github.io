# First Lightning Talk - Project Management in WordPress with Sarah Pressler (@sarahpressler)

 - Team Leadership
 - "If you can handle being yelled at, you'll probably make a good project manager."

# Second Lightning Talk - [The Techie Continuum][techie-continuum] - Kathryn Presner

 - Do I know enough? A question many of us ask ourselves.
 - "I'm not a techie" but I share tech knowledge and people come to me for tech advices.
 - Nightmare - fired before hired.
 - Dwell on your praise - at Automattic, they get hugs from customers and send compliments to each other internally.
 - Don't be afraid to share your knowledge.

# Session 2 - [Developers Toolbox][dev-tools] - Tracy Rotton (@taupecat)

 - Slides: http://taupecat.github.io/wordpress-toolbox
 - Revision control is very important, Git is the way to go.
  - There are alternatives to Git, WordPress has used Subversion for a long time but is slowly switching to git.
  - Repository options: GitHub, Beanstalk, Atlassian Bitbucket, AWS CodeCommit
 - `define( 'DISALLOW_FILE_EDIT', true );` - Set this up so no changes can be done outside of git revisions.
