### Newsletters

 - More voice
 - The Daily Shot
 - Important to the overall strategy - so putting it in front of eyes is important.
 - FBIA signup unit.
 - Every email on your list should be worth a dollar a month.
  - Is the list performing, is the newsletter performing?
  - Once a week readers are highly likely to show up.
 - Repeat opens metric
 - Every list is different and every list responds differently
  - Every user has their own story.
 - Break up the larger list into smaller segments to try and engineer specific experiences
  - Figure out if they respond to mornings or evenings
  - Are they young? Sunday night checkers. People who check at lunch are older.
  - Genders can respond differently.
  - Income levels might respond differently.
 - List cleaning.
 - Quartz's very conversational tone works.

### Decoupled Frontends
 - Embed use significantly increase time to respond.
 - NODE servers don't have a window object and other things need to be shimmed
  - Or remove window interactions
