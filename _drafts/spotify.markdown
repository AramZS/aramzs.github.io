The problem with algorithmic recommendations is that there is no way out, every adjustment just enhances specificity and leaves you with less opportunity to broaden your feed. What if we could create a user experience that doesn't just leverage the algorithm to broaden our horizons, but rewards us for doing so? What if I told you that experience already exists and it integrates into Spotify? 

```(Attached but not in the app, perhaps talk about how it is hooked into or spotify associated)(if it hooks into spotify why isn't it integrated into spotify)(mby cut or minimize this to go straight into interactions within the app)```

I listen to a lot of music and one of the things that I noticed starting to happen is that I got stuck in a rut. Listening to the same things over and over again, but not really picking up anything new. I think this became a lot easier to do once we stopped buying (or even stealing) albums and when I stopped driving because I no longer really encounter music recommendations unless I went out looking for them and when I went out looking for them I ended up at the same places that made the types of recommendations I already got. I was stuck in a bubble of my own music choices and they were starting to bore me. That's when I discovered my new favorite website: [Every Noise at Once](http://everynoise.com).

## Every Noise at Once

At time of my last access, Every Noise at Once describes itself like this:

> Every Noise at Once is an ongoing attempt at an algorithmically-generated, readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical genre-space, based on data tracked and analyzed for 4,778 genre-shaped distinctions by Spotify as of 2020-08-21. The calibration is fuzzy, but in general down is more organic, up is more mechanical and electric; left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier and bouncier.

```

Every Noise at Once is a Spotify-algorithm created attempt to categorize music by genre and then place those genres and the bands that play them in relationship to each other. The [project emerged from trying to understand what a musical genre even is and how one could even recommend songs on that basis](http://everynoise.com/EverynoiseIntro.pdf). 

To just take one example of a genre I frequency listened to, here's what the ENaO graph looks like for Classic Rock:

![Every Noise at Once Band Cloud for Classic Rock](../_includes/classicrock-band-space.PNG)

In the description of how this algorithmic sorting came to be (linked above) engineer Glenn McDonald notes: 

> The approach allows us (or our customers) to seed, and then organically grow, a new genre or style from essentially any inspiration. In a couple peculiar cases, we've gathered an initial artist list, let the computers give us some songs, and only then listened to those songs to find out what kind of music we were even talking about.

By creating a system which can organically enter into a genre and essentially reverse engineer it, Spotify created a tool that lets me really easily break out of any musical bubble and find my way--[wikipedia-effect-style](https://bit.ly/32hN4vJ)--into entirely new universes of music.

## How to Break Out

### Using the Relationship Graph

The first, and most useful, tool that ENaO brings forth is the ability to see the relationship graph of the genre you are interested in. Here's Classic Rock's closely related genres (based on how listeners act, not on any historical reasoning).

![Musical Genres by Closeness of type to Classic Rock](../_includes/classic-rock-sound-space.PNG)

Now if I want to make a small move, say I want to still get some of the sound of classic rock but move away from the core music of the genre I might choose to move towards psychedelic rock, traditional folk, or art rock. But ENaO gives me another option, the inverse graph: 

![Musical Genres by Closeness of type to Classic Rock](../_includes/classic-rock-inverse-sound.PNG)

Now, if I'm feeling like I really want to flip my listening on my head I can pick something totally opposite of my normal genre. Perhaps Fluxwork or some Montreal Indie?

From the Map area of ENaO I can access a whole bunch of resources. The map shows a set of bands that I can try exploring individually and I can use the scatter-plot's two axes set of playlists about the new genre I want to explore. Or I can head to one of the playlist links:

- `playlist` sends me to "The Sounds of [Genre]" playlists on Spotify. When I stumble across an interesting genre I will often save the Sounds Of playlist for later when I'm in the mood to explore it a bit deeper. As a result I have a [whole](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1ga7kXhbcB4tsOfpZqP7UX?si=erThuQAVTlSKKmxMCTNAPw) [bunch](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5m9ErLc15dYYCGzvrcVy8q?si=MUdGuOlGTBm1D2XkSCrC_A) [of](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5INg0fRsoA1uYyyJwliHGS?si=GZvBDr6MQfSMHZ89zY5SjQ) [these](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1qpcTBjAx26Xiw6ZClVVGm?si=rbc7JlryRWuiwJ8OCkassA) [playlists](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1qpcTBjAx26Xiw6ZClVVGm?si=SdUteV0sRgW7JsXEU2bmQg) which essentially act as up-to-date overviews to the genre I can dive into at any time.
- `intro` is essentially an 'introduction' to this genre with music that represents the core sound and is popular among most listeners to the genre. 
- `pulse` is an interesting look at which songs listeners to this genre currently prefer. 
- `edge` is a really fun one that gets you to which songs that people who like this genre currently enjoy outside of the songs within the genre itself. It's also a great tool for pulling yourself out of the a listening rut.

I might go to one or all of those playlists depending on how curious I am in order to find new music and save it to my liked songs.

Mby use this for the part about finding playlists

### Leveraging those "Organic" encounters

In the world of the web "organic" is a term for a piece of content we find through search, and I'm using it similarly here. I am always fast on the Shazam trigger if I hear a song I like the sound of in a restaurant, movie, or film. In the days I would go outside because we weren't in a pandemic I'd hit up Sofar Sounds concerts, where you show up not knowing what music you are going to hear. This is always a lot of fun. Once I get a song I like that doesn't really sound like anything else I listen to the first thing I'll do is head to the artist's `About` page on Spotify which links to `Discovered On` a set of playlists that include this artist. Often there will be a Sounds Of playlist there (or I can search the artist in Every Noise at Once using the band search on the home page).

A good example is the time I heard [Pinc Louds](https://open.spotify.com/artist/5G4Nw3oz2lzx4gneIDs3YX?si=QudiVNJ8TtGArdx7EPxS9w)' "Soul in My Body" and exploring their About page and their "Fans Also Like" area led me to an excellent user-created playlist around the genre [Queercore](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/35kaiqB2MRyWSTs9fZfxIE?si=OYpl6hWtSkCN3rzkoNVCtQ). Though I could have easily ended up at the [genre page](http://everynoise.com/engenremap-queercore.html) or found my way to Pinc Louds' listed genre on ENaO and checked out the playlist for the sound of [Puerto Rican Indie](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/6RvOIQPUfQg7kGde06Wdas?si=J5XR5KPYS56UD4AFdcBYRQ).

### Stealing from Friends

```
Perhaps position elsewhere this doesn't play well in the flow between the previous and next section.
```

Did you know that the Discovery playlist that Spotify generates each week for you is sharable? I stumbled across this by watching the Friend Activity feed and now I have a folder of playlists that is entirely other people's Discovery playlists. It's great because I have a lot of friends with better and sometimes much different musical taste than me. Hopping into a friend's Discover playlist to try and discover something outside of your comfort zone is a lot of fun and another great way to find something entirely different to listen to. 

![Breaking my grove by breaking my Discover playlist](https://media1.tenor.com/images/f2688dbd3ace6baed89be514193dfba7/tenor.gif?itemid=14993711)

I'm [pretty sure I've broken my Discover playlist](https://twitter.com/Chronotope/status/1000748313963089921) because it seems to often be filled with stuff I don't particularly like, but occasionally there will be something great in there, so you can [make mine the first you explore](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/37i9dQZEVXcEWUzYxxxhEC?si=Fipy_U5nSGKKuYtoi4HQXw) if you're not already doing this.

## Taking a Deeper Look

Once I find a song or genre I like, that doesn't mean every related song is my cup of tea. Just like I like some classic rock bands, but not others. This is the part where I can "hack" the algorithm to help me develop an ear for a particular genre without knowing much about it. This is especially useful for me when I, an English-speaker, am exploring non-English genres. Here's how it works: 

My neighborhood Vietnamese restaurant plays really great Thai music. Of course, I didn't know what type of music it was or even what language it was in when I first heard it, I had to Shazam it. The nature of exploring music this way is sort of naive so please excuse any factual errors to follow. Over the course of one dinner I had a few songs that I could explore. "[โคตรเลวในดวงใจ](https://open.spotify.com/album/4qTYvKGgpzAv8RZ7xlriKb?highlight=spotify:track:2PVLzzBM6KslHNMtxBYV3A)" by Takkatan Chollada is classified as Thai pop country. "[เสียเวลาว่ะ](https://open.spotify.com/track/1CxiMGrvmnbLjaetq7SKhN?si=io8zyGfeRnuDTWbZtlYUEQ)" by electric.neon.lamp is in Thai pop indie playlists while "[เสพติดความเจ็บปวด](https://open.spotify.com/track/0vUIzJuMzRAiPUn9xTyAzi?si=hRhlmYGgRbmdYIN5CJDxmw)" by The Yers appears to be Thai pop rock. 

```
Perhaps add more images here about how to find these playlists?
```

Alright, so it looks like I enjoy Thai Pop music. Now I can throw these songs together into a playlist. When I create a playlist like that around songs from a new genre I like, it only takes a very few songs and I can start to scroll to the bottom and use the Recommended Songs area. By hoping into there and listening for what I like I can develop a playlist of the parts of a genre I enjoy best without really knowing a lot except the sounds of what I enjoy. 

## Getting a Taste

```
Mby mention pandora and it's corporate relationship with the underlying recommendation technology.
```

Once I do this for long enough, I start to develop a better ear for the subtleties in any genre, I may not have the tools of a music academic, so I can't put the right words to it, but I can start to *hear* particular sounds or auditory themes that I'll groove to. I start by adding those into the playlist, but eventually it comes time to subdivide. When I started, I saw all three of those above songs as "Thai Pop" but by looking at what playlists they are in and listening to them and the recommended songs that I enjoy I have started to get a sense of what differentiates those songs.

Now I can split my playlist into three genres of Thai music that I enjoy: [Thai Pop](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3yJyMaXnoA9iEXto8cjqOf?si=hm0HVXqRTvy2JU6Fa5WSKQ), [Thai Rock](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/5bxHbqPqbhD6P0iZqD9TXt?si=BAbjijwdRDC6qRpafRbK2w), and [Luk thung](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3ZgqvMI5bKyVeES6LGxgtN?si=8VQrMJjfSEGZKanAUdwJBQ) (please excuse my ignorance as there is not a lot easily translatable or in English about most non-English music genres, but a rough description of this genre--as I understand it--is Thai Folk Country music. I highly recommend the [Luk thung Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luk_thung).)

## Every Day I'm Shuffling

The Recommended Songs list at the end of every playlist is so key to this process and it is a particularly fascinating piece of the user interface for Spotify. It represents a radically different way of interacting with a recommendation algorithm that differs from every other social platform. It's the difference between being directed by the algorithm as a subject vs you directing the algorithm as a tool.
