excerpt: Spotify's user experience asks us to control recommendations, instead of letting it control us.

The problem with algorithmic recommendations is that there is no way out, every adjustment just enhances specificity and leaves you with less opportunity to broaden your feed. What if we could create a user experience that doesn't just leverage the algorithm to broaden our horizons, but rewards us for doing so? What if I told you that experience already exists and it is Spotify? 

I listen to a lot of music and one of the things that I noticed starting to happen is that I got stuck in a rut. Listening to the same things over and over again, but not really picking up anything new. I think this became a lot easier to do once we stopped buying (or even stealing) albums and when I stopped driving because I no longer really encounter music recommendations unless I went out looking for them and when I went out looking for them I ended up at the same places that made the types of recommendations I already got. I was stuck in a bubble of my own music choices and they were starting to bore me. That's when I discovered my new favorite website: [Every Noise at Once](http://everynoise.com). 

## Every Noise at Once

At time of my last access, Every Noise at Once describes itself like this:

> Every Noise at Once is an ongoing attempt at an algorithmically-generated, readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical genre-space, based on data tracked and analyzed for 4,778 genre-shaped distinctions by Spotify as of 2020-08-21. The calibration is fuzzy, but in general down is more organic, up is more mechanical and electric; left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier and bouncier.
