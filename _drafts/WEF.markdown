## Economics
- Sharing signals of repute and direpute
- Alerts to campaigns of disinfromation 
- Moving to a digital media economy. 
- How can we change the way we leverage user data in a way that positions publishers of journalism more effectively
- How can we do so in a way that provides users more agency

## User Data 
- Truth agency - https://www.truth.agency/

- Inspiration
    - Private Ad Exchanges 
    - News consortiums
    - User data portability
    - Data as a revenue stream as users have data portability and can shop from location to location with their own data. 

### Pangea Alliance
- Had to find common ground - something that united the orgs. 
    - Responsiblity to quality content, advertising & journalism 
    - Shared audiance insights and profiles
    - Price point that makes sense as a combined offering 
    - Commonality of products formats and technology. 
    - Shared vision of industry challenges and success.
- They are nonprofit 
- Content and context is very important. 
- 80% or above viewability - higher standards than the norm. 
- Only 4 price points. 
- How it works
    - Do not collect first party data from publishers. 
    - Push data based on content. 
    - Value is added because different publishers have different content profiles. 
    - Works with Krux as a DMP. 
    - DMP splits and segments layers of ad content. 
    - (Ok, so they are pushing meta data from content to Krux?)
    - How are they getting the audiance profiles? 
    - Sometimes have PMPs specific to a particular deal. 
    - Annonomize it both ways 
    - Krux is the user table for id.
    - (https://digitalcontentnext.org/blog/2017/11/14/personalization-without-people-happens-no-one-can-track-consumers/)
    - Can't share homework for pricing calls b/c of antitrust.
    - Kept price point fairly static b/c cooperation where the publishers vote yay or nay on pricing is complex.

- Project Arete - a platform to demonstrate ad targeting transparency 
    - Understand which technologies have been used at which stage of trading.

    - A game you can't win right now. 
    - Why is the game going to change? GDPR mby. Web browser for sure. 
- Advertisers want to know how we're going to protect their data

### Consumer Commons 
- Facebook is just the tip of the user tracking iceburg 
- Ad tech has not just created the environment for fraud, it has hurt journalism as well. 
- Publishers are perpetuating the terrible survailance machine ad tech system. 
- Ad blocking took off in reaction--in part--to DNT being blocked. But perhaps also video ads.

    - People were not prepared for the IAB to come down on them. 
    - Tracking Preference Extension ? Sounds bad. 
    - Wasn't good communication with browsers about the rollout. 
    - Don't put lawyers in a tech working group 
    - Made a collective action problem without a collective action problem. 
    - Use it as a competitive advantage.
