I am coming to think that it isn't just Uber and AirBnB. The fundamental ethical flaw of the sharing economy is basically the same in every tech 'disruption' to arrive in the current tech bubble (2004-????) empowers the same goal, to slowly replace professional labor with untrained, ill-performing consumers who are willing to spend their free time to promote the growth of the platform to which they pledge allegiance.

Most major consumer-facing Silicon Valley tech tools of the last decade push you to spend your free time in competition with paid labor that performs similar functions. As a result, all money leaves the market in which Technology X and App Y arrive in, that money, moves from a variety of classes and workers, who were previously paid to accomplish tasks, to technology platforms that optimize the performance of the same tasks to maximize the competition of 'your free time' with paid labor for the same tasks you're doing in that time. That money, saved by replacing paid with free labor, then flows to the most effective technology for optimization. The labor savings is spent on technological tools. All money flows towards tech because it is actively eliminating the existence of monetary compensation everywhere else.

The problem of the future, then, isn't about the robot-ification of labor. It is about the elimination whole swaths of labor because we're too stupid to understand that we are intrinsically devaluing ourselves and our communities. These will be tasks not completed by robots, but by underpaid labor willing to poorly price their own time.

You need to learn to code, not because of moral imperative, or ethics, but because there is no competition in the long term with labor willing to work for free. And the goal of the modern round of technology is to collect and optimize free-working labor.

You need to learn to code because if the current arc completes, there will be no paid jobs that aren't technology jobs.

The value of driving in a market where people are willing to drive in their free time and ignore the costs of the labor of maintenance will eventually be 0, because if you're competing with people who drive for fun, no earning is too low for that group.

The value of living space in a market where people are willing to sell their extra space and ignore the costs of maintenance will eventually be 0, because competing with people who do it for fun is an impossible competition.

The value of writing in a market where an ever steady, if not increasing, number of writers are willing to work for free is 0, because value is set by the lowest bidder.

The value of content distribution in a world where people push out that content to peers for free is inevitably 0.

All markets which are described as 'doing it for fun and maybe a few extra dollars' will inevitably collapse value to near zero.

All markets where people genuinely work for exposure on a large scale and consistent basis over a longer term will inevitably collapse value to near zero.
